# Mission: Script Mode Mini Show

## Goal

Practice running Python in **script mode** and using **multiple** `print` statements.

When you are done, your script should print **at least three different lines** of text.

Think of it as a tiny show: each `print` is a new line in the performance.

## What you'll use

- File: `attachments/script_mode_experiments.py`
- Language: Python

## Your mission

You will turn this script into a little status log, intro screen, or mini story.
When you run the file, Python will perform every line from top to bottom.

## Steps

1. Open the file `attachments/script_mode_experiments.py`.
2. Read the comments at the top so you know what the file is about.
3. Notice the first `print` line that is already there.
4. **Do not delete** the first `print`.
5. Under that line, add **at least two more** `print` statements. For example:
   - A boot-up message: `print("System online.")`
   - A fun fact: `print("Fun fact: 2 ** 10 is 1024.")`
   - A school-appropriate joke.
6. Make sure each `print` shows a **different** message.
7. Save the file.
8. Run the script and watch all the lines appear in the output.

## You're done when

- [ ] Your file contains **three or more** `print(...)` lines.
- [ ] Each `print` shows a **non-empty** message.
- [ ] The messages are not all exactly the same.
- [ ] When you run the script once, you see at least three lines of output, one for each `print`.

## Optional bonus (for hackers)

- Add a line that prints a fake error message like: `print("ERROR: dragons not found")`.
- Or make the three lines feel like a tiny story intro for a game.

(These creative twists are optional; the checker just looks for multiple print lines with real text.)
