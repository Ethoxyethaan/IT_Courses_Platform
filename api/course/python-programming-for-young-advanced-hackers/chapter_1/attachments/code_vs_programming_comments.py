Code vs Programming Storyboard
------------------------------

Read the comments below. Some describe PROGRAMMING (planning, designing,
thinking about the problem). Others are actual CODE (instructions for
Python to run).

TASK:
  1. Go through each line and decide: is it PROGRAMMING or CODE?
  2. You can write your answers in a separate notebook or add comments
     like # PROGRAMMING or # CODE at the end of each line.
"""

# Step 1: Decide what the program should do.
# Step 2: We want to greet the user with their name.

# Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable.
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Plan: If the user does not type anything, we will still say hello.

# Print a friendly greeting.
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Step 3: Later we could add more features, like asking for their age.
