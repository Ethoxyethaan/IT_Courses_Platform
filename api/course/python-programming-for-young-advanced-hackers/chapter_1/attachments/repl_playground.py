# Talk to the Python REPL
# ------------------------
# This file gives you ideas for what to try in the Python REPL.
# You DO NOT run this file directly. Instead:
#   1. Open a Python REPL (for example, in Mu or another editor).
#   2. Type the lines below one by one.
#   3. Press Enter after each line and watch what happens.

# Try some math:
1 + 2
5 * 10
10 / 3

# Try some text (strings):
"Python"
"Hello" + " " + "World"

# Try the print function:
print("Hello, World!")
print("2 + 2 is", 2 + 2)

# Try mixing things up:
print("Python is fun!")

# After you are done experimenting, close the REPL.
