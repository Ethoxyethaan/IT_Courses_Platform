# Mission: REPL Playground

## Goal

Use the Python **REPL** (Read–Eval–Print Loop) to try out math, strings, and `print`.

You will type one line at a time and see how Python answers you back.

## What you'll use

- A Python REPL or interactive shell (for example, running `python` in a terminal, or using your editor's "Python console").
- Optional: `attachments/repl_playground.py` as a list of ideas to try.

## What is the REPL?

The REPL is like a chat with Python:

1. You **type** something.
2. Python **evaluates** it.
3. Python **prints** the result.
4. Then it waits for your next line.

It's your safe sandbox: if something breaks, you just try again.

## Steps

Open a Python REPL, then type each of these lines **exactly** and press Enter after each one.
Watch what Python prints back.

### Try some math

1. Type: `1 + 2`  → you should see: `3`
2. Type: `5 * 10` → you should see: `50`
3. Type: `10 / 3` → you should see a number that starts with `3.3` (like `3.3333333`).

### Try some text (strings)

4. Type: `"Python"` → Python shows the value, usually like: `'Python'`
5. Type: `"Hello" + " " + "World"` → the value should contain `Hello World`.

### Try the `print` function

6. Type: `print("Hello, World!")` → you should see the text:

   Hello, World!

   printed as output.

You can also try extra lines from `attachments/repl_playground.py` or invent your own.

## You're done when

- [ ] You opened a Python REPL or interactive shell.
- [ ] You typed each example line **one at a time** and pressed Enter.
- [ ] You saw number answers for math expressions.
- [ ] You saw strings with quotes when you just typed them, and without quotes when you used `print(...)`.
- [ ] You tried at least one extra experiment of your own.

## Optional bonus (mini experiments)

Try a couple of these just for fun:

- `2 ** 10`
- `'ha' * 5`
- `print("Python REPL level: unlocked")`

Notice how quickly you can test ideas here compared to writing and saving a whole script.
