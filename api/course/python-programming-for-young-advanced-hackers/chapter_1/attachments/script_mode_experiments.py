# Script Mode Mini Experiments
# ----------------------------
# This script starts with a single print statement.
# TASK 1: Run it and see what it does.
# TASK 2: Add TWO MORE print lines below so that the script prints
#         three different messages, one on each line.

print("This is my first script line!")

# Example (you can change the messages):
# print("This is my second line.")
# print("This is my third line.")
