# Mission: Boot Up Your First Hello, World! Script

## Goal

Turn a blank-ish Python file into your first real script in **script mode**.

When you run your script, it should print exactly:

Hello, World!

(with the same capitalization, comma, exclamation mark, and spacing).

Think of it as setting up the welcome banner for your future hacker terminal.

## What you'll use

- File: `attachments/hello_world.py`
- Language: Python

## Steps

1. Open the file `attachments/hello_world.py` in your editor.
2. Read the comments at the top so you know what this file is for.
3. Find the place in the file where you should write your code.
4. Add a line of code that uses `print` to show the message:
   - It should look like this when you are done:
     - `print("Hello, World!")`
5. Save the file.
6. Run the script from your editor or terminal.
7. Look at the output window or terminal.

## You're done when

- [ ] Your program uses the `print` function.
- [ ] The text is **exactly** `Hello, World!` (same letters, comma, space, and `!`).
- [ ] When you run the file, you see **one** line of output: `Hello, World!`.
- [ ] The program ends after printing; there is no extra text.

## Optional bonus (for extra XP)

After you pass the check and see `Hello, World!` working:

- Add another `print` line that says something like `print("Boot sequence complete.")`.
- Or change the message in a **copy** of this file to greet someone by name.

(These extras are just for fun and practice  the grader only cares about the core `Hello, World!` script.)
